## üëã About This Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode journey!

This repository serves as a personal log of the data structure and algorithm problems I've solved on LeetCode using **Java**. My primary goal is not just to find a working solution, but to practice writing **clean, efficient, and readable code**‚Äîthe kind that's expected in a professional software engineering environment.

## üß≠ Navigating the Repository

Given the large number of solutions, instead of maintaining a manual list, you can easily find any solution and its corresponding explanation by following the repository's structure.

### 1. Finding the Solution Code (`.java` files)

All solution code is located in the following directory:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è `src/main/java/com/manhtruong03/leetcode/editor/en/`

The Java file names correspond to the LeetCode problem titles in `PascalCase`.

* **Example:** The solution for the "Two Sum" problem is located in `TwoSum.java`.

### 2. Finding Notes & Explanations (`.md` files)

A key feature of this repository is that I document my thought process for many of the problems. You can find these detailed explanations here:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è `src/main/java/com/manhtruong03/leetcode/doc/content/`

In this directory, you'll find Markdown (`.md`) files detailing the thought process, algorithm choices, and complexity analysis for the solutions.

### Example: How to find the "Valid Anagram" problem

1.  **CODE:** Navigate to `.../leetcode/editor/en/` and look for the file `ValidAnagram.java`.
2.  **EXPLANATION:** Navigate to `.../leetcode/doc/content/` and look for the file `ValidAnagram.md`.

This structure keeps the repository organized and scalable without the need for constant README updates.
